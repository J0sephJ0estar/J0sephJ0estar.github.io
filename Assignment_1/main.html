&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last class, we have learn many knowledge about transformation. Now you need to complete the project II 
this week, I guess teacher has introduced the detail about this project, please create your stick man and let it move like a real man, I believe 
you can complete it perfectly. You can get the instruction from "No.5 Transformation" P63-82.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this section I'll introduce my self-made stickman roughly, which is made using C with openGl. 
The following are some main points. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Body drawing issues: There're several parts in human body and they are connected with each other. Using cubes
to represent all the parts here, and for each cube, the coordinates of 6 points are needed to draw 12 lines.
Body can be devided into different layers, say main layers and subordinate layers. The movement of sub-layers are affected by the main ones, 
but they have their own way of moving too. So we may draw the main layers firstly, setting up their moving styles, and then it's time for 
the sub-layers. In openGL, we can use glPushMatrix() and glPopMatix() to achieve this way of drawing. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Movement issues: As a matter of fact, there's no continuous movement in my work.
 Instead, I break a movement into pieces and draw it by and by once after a small interval. The so-called "walking around" here is the
 whole body(image) rotating round the z-axis. Also, the so-called "rotating" is achieved by changing the angle every time on body drawing. 
For instance, we use glRotatef(angle,0,0,1) for the "rotating" movement, and every loop an "a" is added to "angle" so that it seems the body 
is walking in a round way.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturality issues: To make the movement of my stickman more natural, that is to say, to make it act as if a real man,
 there's a lot to do. But eventually what I've done is still very superficial. In the second part, the rotating action has been discussed. For legs and arms,
 they also move as if rotate round an axis, but their axises are more partial. To achieve a view of walking around, the whole body should be set 
 to rotate round z-axis located in original point, but for arms/legs, the axis they rotate round is x-axis and the start points is in layers higher than them.
 For two parts in a single leg/arm, it's all the same. The upper part and lower part rotate round their higher layer, and for the lower one, the upper one is
 also its higher layer. In detail, there are two parts in both arms and legs. A single leg/arm move together on the whole, but the lower part will have its
 own way of rotating contrast to their upper pair. For arms, when the upper is in front of body and moving forward, the lower one moves faster till reaches
 a certain angle(still bigger than upper one finally); so when the upper is in front of body and moving backward, the lower one will move faster till parallel
 to the upper, which acts as a arm-shaking. For legs, when the upper is behind body, the rotation angle of the lower one is a bit larger than former one which
 shows as if it's bent. To make all these work well, it requires many if-else condition statements and two parameters added to arms and legs separately, whose sign acts
 as a singnal to determine the direction of arms/legs moving.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you can get the source code here:

<a href="unistd.h">unistd.h</a>.
