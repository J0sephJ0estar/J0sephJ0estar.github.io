&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last class,we have learn many knowledge about transformation. Now you need to complete the project II 
this week, I guess teacher has introduced the detail about this project, please create your stick man and let it move like a real man, I believe 
you can complete it perfectly. You can get the instruction from "No.5 Transformation" P63-82.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this section I'll introduce my self-made stick man roughly, which is made by codeblocks with openGl. 
The following are some main points. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body drawing issues: There're several parts in human body and they are connected with each other. 
They can be devided into different layers, say main layers and subordinate layers. The movement of sub-layers are affected by the main ones, 
but they have their own way of moving also. So we may draw the main layers firstly, setting up their moving styles, and then it's time for the sub-layers.
 In openGL, we can use glPushMatrix() and glPopMatix() to achieve this way of drawing. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement issues: As a matter of fact, there's no continuous movement in my work.
 Instead, I break a movement into pieces and draw it by and by after a small interval. The so-called "walking around" here is
 whole body(image) rotating round the z-axis. Also, the so-called "rotating" is achieved by changing the angle every time on body drawing. 
For instance, we use glRotatef(angle,0,0,1) for the "rotating" movement, and every loop an "a" is added to angle so that it seems the body 
is walking in a round way.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you can get the source code here:
<a href="code.c">code.c</a>.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run it in windows with openGL, you may also need this:
<a href="unistd.h">unistd.h</a>.
